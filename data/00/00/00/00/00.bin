  |   Winner of Best Game at the 2018 BAFTA Game Awards, as well as Best    |
  |   Narrative awards at the GDC 2018 Choice Awards, 2018 SXSW Gaming      |
  |   Awards, and The Game Awards 2017, What Remains of Edith Finch is a    |
  |   collection of strange tales about a family in Washington state.       |
  |                                                                         |
  |   As Edith, you'll explore the colossal Finch house, searching for      |
  |   stories as she explores her family history and tries to figure out    |
  |   why she's the last one in her family left alive. Each story you       |
  |   find lets you experience the life of a new family member on the day   |
  |   of their death, with stories ranging from the distant past to the     |
  |   present day.                                                          |
  |                                                                         |
  |   The gameplay and tone of the stories are as varied as the Finches     |
  |   themselves. The only constants are that each is played from a         |
  |   first-person perspective and that each story ends with that family    |
  |   member's death.                                                       |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Ultimately, it's a game about what it feels like to be humbled and    |
  |   astonished by the vast and unknowable world around us.                |
  |                                                                         |
